**NOTE**

* This bot needs to run on a system that has Java installed. Please refer to https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html .
* Please activate the bot only when you are under "attack". There is no sense otherwise in keeping the bot online as it might lead to false positives. Turn off the bot when you are not being harassed.
* This bot can NOT anticipate accounts faster than the following pipeline by twitch. This means that when one of the accounts tries to follow you, it will still fire an alert before the ban has happened. This is why we will aim to pre-emptively ban these accounts whenever possible. 
* Note that JavaSaurus Studios is in no way responsible for false positives, this is a tool to help the community flag and beat troll accounts that have been set up to insult, annoy and harass streamers. FunkyDactyl has the sole purpose that YOUR stream can continue, keeping the nasties out of your community.


***Happy streaming, hope to see you soon at www.twitch.tv/javasaurusstudios***
